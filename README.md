# üé£ Eth . Fish

Casual group game to teach Ethereum asset custody using burner wallets as PWAs

Start game takes you to random route where other people can join - you act as a gas dropper for people that join (can you install a specific fishing hole to your Home Screen? Do we force it?)

Screen to show fishing pond to set the vibe (share button on fishing pond and list of people there with their total weight caught) 

One overlay to show if you have cast out (players are either cast out or reeled in) 

Watching block hashes, the hash of the fishing hole and cast out must match (think leading zeros) to make a valid ‚Äúbite‚Äù 

If player ‚Äúreels in‚Äù soon enough they get minted an onchain SVG fish with random characteristics 

This is also tracked in a leader board for the specific fishing hole 

Clicking on any player including yourself takes you to their inventory (if you are the owner you can send the fish) 

The leader board is tracking fish caught not fish in inventory - you can send them around all you want
